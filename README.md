# React Shopping Cart

Description: This project contains a list of products with the functionality to add item into the cart, remove item(s) from the cart, and to restock products. As items are added, removed, and restocked, there is capability to view the cost of the items, the current amount in stock, which country the item comes from, the total cost in the checkout, and the final list of checked out items. 

How to Run: This project uses Strapi to create the database and Postman to test data. To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and host a local server to run the React component. 

Roadmap: This project can evolve to have additional details be displayed such as a counter for how many of each product resides in the cart.
